Program uses the twitter API for accessing a large number of tweets.
They are mostly limited to about 2 weeks of tweets, however should be plently for this
small analyzer.

<h2>
Installation

<p>
Note that the following needs to be applied in the twitter.py.
Got to: <a>https://apps.twitter.com/</a> to make an account to apply these links:
<ul>
    <li>ACCESS_TOKEN = ''
    <li>ACCESS_SECRET = ''
    <li>CONSUMER_KEY = ''
    <li>CONSUMER_SECRET = ''
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You should be set!
Just execute twitter.py either through an 
ide or via python3 twitter

The prompts should walk you through the rest. 
5 files will be generated.

output.txt contains the raw file output.
The next 4 will contian any interesting data as described by
their file titles.
